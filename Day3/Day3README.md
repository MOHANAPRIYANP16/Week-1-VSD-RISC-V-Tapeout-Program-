## Constant Propagation  
### 1. What is it?  
- Replace signals driven by **constant values (0 or 1)** with fixed logic.  
- Eliminates unnecessary gates and wires.  

### 2. Detailed Info  
Constant propagation checks if a net or signal always evaluates to a fixed value and simplifies the circuit accordingly. For example, if a gate input is always `0`, the output can be optimized to `0` without the actual logic.  

### Advantages  
- Reduces **gate count**  
- Simplifies **logic equations**  
- Improves **area and power efficiency**  

---

## State Optimization  
### 1. What is it?  
- Reduces the number of **states in a finite state machine (FSM)** by merging equivalent or unreachable states.  

### 2. Detailed Info  
In FSMs, some states may be redundant (behaving the same as others) or unreachable. State optimization identifies and removes them, leading to a minimal FSM.  

###  Advantages  
- Reduces **flip-flop count**  
- Improves **timing** (fewer state transitions)  
- Lower **area and power** usage  

---


## Cloning  
### 1. What is it?  
- Duplicate logic or registers to **reduce fanout** and **improve timing**.  

### 2. Detailed Info  
If a single gate or flip-flop drives many loads, the delay increases. Cloning creates a copy of that logic/register so loads are split between them.  

###  Advantages  
- Reduces **net delay** from high fanout  
- Improves **timing closure**  
- Helps achieve **higher operating frequency**

---

## Retiming  
### 1. What is it?  
- **Reposition registers (flip-flops)** in a circuit without changing functionality.  

### 2. Detailed Info  
Retiming balances combinational delays by moving flip-flops across logic gates. It helps meet setup/hold timing while preserving overall input-output behavior.  

###  Advantages  
- Optimizes **critical path delay**  
- Enables **higher clock frequency**  
- Balances **pipeline stages** for better performance

# 5. Labs On Optimization

Optimization in digital design ensures **minimal area**, **reduced power consumption**, and **improved timing performance**.  
This lab explores **Combinational** and **Sequential Logic Optimization** techniques.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Combinational Logic Optimization
###  Objective:
Squeeze and simplify logic to achieve the **most optimized design** in terms of **area** and **power**.

---

###  Techniques:

#### 1. Constant Propagation
- Replaces **logic blocks with constants** when input values are fixed.  
- **Example:**
  `Y = ((AÂ·B) + C)'
If A = 0 â†’ Y = (0 + C)' = C'`

- **Result:**  
- Complex gate logic â†’ **6 MOS transistors**  
- Simplified to â†’ **1 inverter (2 MOS transistors)** 

---

#### 2. Boolean Logic Optimization
- Simplify Boolean expressions using:
- Karnaugh Map (K-Map)  
- Quine McCluskey Method  
- **Example Verilog:**
```verilog
assign y = a ? (b ? c : (c ? a : 0)) : (!c);
```
  - Optimized Expression:
    
     `y = a âŠ• c`

  ### Yosys Optimization Commands:
  
  - The command to perform logic optimization in Yosys is opt_clean.
    ```
       opt_clean
    ```
  - Additionally, for a hierarchical design involving multiple sub-modules, the design must be flattened by running the flatten command before executing the opt_clean command.
   ```
    flatten
   ```
  ### Full Flow:

  ```
  synth -top <module_name>
  opt_clean -purge
```
- `opt_clean` â†’ removes unused wires and cells

- `-purge`    â†’ also removes internal nets with public names
 ---

## ðŸ”¹ Sequential Logic Optimization

### Basic Techniques:
 
#### 1.Sequential Constant Propagation:

- Propagates known constant values through flip-flops during synthesis.

 **Advanced Techniques:**
 
 #### 1. State Optimization

- Reduces the number of FSM states â†’ optimizing area and transitions.

 #### 2. Retiming

Moves registers across logic boundaries to balance delay and improve timing.

 #### 3. Sequential Logic Cloning

- Duplicates logic in floorplan-aware synthesis to meet timing and congestion goals.

**Outcome:**
- These optimization techniques ensure faster, smaller, and power-efficient circuits, ready for real-world chip design.

##Sequential Logic Optimization

## Lab 5 :
 
Verilog code:
 
![dff_const1](Images/dff_const1verilogfile.v.png)

**Functionality:**

- D flip-flop with:
    - reset to 0
    - Loads constant 1 when not in reset

Dot file:

![dff1](dffconst1dotfile.png)


## Lab 6 :

Verilog code:

![dff2](dffconst2verilog.png)

## Functionality of `dff_const2`

- On **reset** (`posedge reset`): `q` becomes `1`.  
- On **clock edge** (`posedge clk`): `q` also becomes `1`.  
- Therefore, output `q` is **always `1`**, independent of clock or reset.

### After Synthesis
The flip-flop is redundant.  
The circuit is optimized to:

    assign q = 1'b1;
